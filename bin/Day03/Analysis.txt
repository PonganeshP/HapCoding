Time Complexity:
    Rate of growth of execution time with respect to increase in input size.

Practise finding time complexity.
    Focus on how much iterations it takes to execute a code.


[] -> Inclusive
() -> Exclusive

Sum of n natural numbers -> O(n^2) times
Arithmetic Progression -> O(n^2) times
Geometric Progression -> O(K^n) times
