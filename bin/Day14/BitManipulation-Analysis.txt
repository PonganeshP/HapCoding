Application of Bit manipulation in Prblm Solving:

1) Help from Sam: Using right shift operator

Alex and Sam are good friends. Alex is doing a lot of programming these days. He has set a target score of A for himself.
Initially, Alex's score was zero. Alex can double his score by doing a question, or Alex can seek help from Sam for doing questions that will contribute 1 to Alex's score. Alex wants his score to be precisely A. Also, he does not want to take much help from Sam.

Find and return the minimum number of times Alex needs to take help from Sam to achieve a score of A.

2)  Finding Good Days: Using right shift operator

Alex has a cat named Boomer. He decides to put his cat to the test for eternity.
He starts on day 1 with one stash of food unit, every next day, the stash doubles.
If Boomer is well behaved during a particular day, only then she receives food worth equal to the stash produced on that day.
Boomer receives a net worth of A units of food. What is the number of days she received the stash?

3) 5 power of instead of 2 power of:

Given an integer A, find and return the Ath magic number.
A magic number is defined as a number that can be expressed as a power of 5 or a sum of unique powers of 5.
First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.

4) Reverse bits:

5) Intersting Array using XOR properties:

You have an array A with N elements. We have two types of operation available on this array :
We can split an element B into two elements, C and D, such that B = C + D.
We can merge two elements, P and Q, to one element, R, such that R = P ^ Q i.e., XOR of P and Q.
You have to determine whether it is possible to convert array A to size 1, containing a single element equal to 0 after several splits and/or merge?
