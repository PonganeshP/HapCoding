 * Problem Description
Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.

Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
NOTE:
1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.

Return the ans % 10000003.


Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 2
 B = 5
 C = [1, 10]
Input 2:

 A = 10
 B = 1
 C = [1, 8, 11, 3]


Example Output
Output 1:

 50
Output 2:

 11


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Possibility 1:- One painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55 units.
 Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time take = max(5, 50) = 50
 There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
 ans = 50 % 10000003
Explanation 2:

 Each block is painted by a painter so, Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, painter 3 paints block 3 
 and painter 4 paints block 4, time taken = max(1, 8, 11, 3) = 11
 ans = 11 % 10000003
